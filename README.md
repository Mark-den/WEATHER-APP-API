# Weather (Simple Static Web App)

A minimal static webpage that displays weather-related UI. This project contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript needed to run the app in a browser.

## Project structure

- index.html — main page
- script.js — application JavaScript
- style.css — styles

## Setup & Run

No build tools or dependencies required. To run locally, open the `index.html` file in your browser.

Quick steps:

1. Open the project folder in your file explorer.
2. Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser.

Or from a terminal (optional simple server):

```powershell
# from project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Notes

- This is a static client-side project. If you plan to add API calls, consider securing keys and using a backend.
